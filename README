ActionHelper
============

ActionHelper is a Rails plugin that allows you to create view helper modules 
for specific actions or templates, as oppose to the controller-wide helper 
facility Rails provides.  

Example
=======

class ExampleController < ActionController::Base
  include ActionHelper
  
  def sweetness()
    ...
  end
  
end

The ActionView::Base object that renders the response for the #sweetness 
action will have ExampleSweetnessHelper mixed in, if the module exists.

TODO
====

Almost everything ... this is super-alpha.
