ActionHelper
============

ActionHelper is a Rails plugin that allows you to create view helper modules 
for specific actions or templates, as oppose to the controller-wide helper 
facility Rails provides.  

Example
=======

There are currently two ways to get action-specific helpers mixed in.

module ExampleSweetnessHelper ... end

class ExampleController < ActionController::Base
  include ActionHelper
  
  def sweetness
    ...
  end
  
  def supercool; action_helper ExampleSweetnessHelper
    ...
  end
end

Because of a naming convention similar to Rails' built in helper support, the 
template object that renders the response for the #sweetness action will have 
ExampleSweetnessHelper mixed in.  (To be clear, when processing 
FooController#bar, ActionHelper will look for FooBarHelper.)

By calling #action_helper, the #supercool action gets ExampleSweetnessHelper 
for its template too.

TODO
====

* Allow an action to declare what helper(s) it wants by name in addition to 
  passing the module itself (same as Rails does).
* Build up a master module for each action so we're not doing so many extends 
  on every request.
* Experiment with keying off the template name rather than the action (to deal 
  with actions that might render alternate templates)
