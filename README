ActionHelper
============

ActionHelper is a Rails plugin that allows you to create view helper modules 
for specific actions or templates, as oppose to the controller-wide helper 
facility Rails provides.  

Example
=======

class ExampleController < ActionController::Base
  include ActionHelper
  
  def sweetness
    ...
  end
  
end

The ActionView::Base object that renders the response for the #sweetness 
action will have ExampleSweetnessHelper mixed in, if the module exists.

TODO
====

Almost everything ... this is super-alpha.
* Allow an action to declare what helper(s) it wants beyond the default
* Experiment with keying off the template name rather than the action (to deal 
  with actions that might render alternate templates)
